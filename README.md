# DataPipelineTest-Weather

Hello everyone, this is a half-baked test project. This involved extracting data from the OpenWeatherMap API, building a data pipeline that channels its data into 
a SQL script that can be run on DBeaver, and loading the data to be explored further on Tableau. 
OWM_Weather_ELT_V1 was the initial Jupyter notebook use for data loading. 
WeatherDataExtraction(ELT_Fin) was the Jupyter notebook that successfully loaded the data, created a pipeline, and inserted the data into the table created in DBeaver. 
DDL_Script_weather.sql was a script used to create a table in DBeaver to load data into it. 
Tableau.twb is the Tableau workbook used to explore the data.
